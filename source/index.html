            I am a proponent of good, clean code and all the tools necessary to create it. A great craftsman is a an even better tool master. Without good tools, it's harder to reach great potential. I'm a test-driven development advocate and I follow <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> development practices for object-oriented code. I take pride in my work and feel accomplished when code can be easily maintained and extended in addition to solve tough problems.

          <p>
            Great development goes beyond the code in an application. It should spill over into the process of building great products as well. DevOps automation increases process scalability and reliability, removes unnecessary human dependencies and descritizes tasks into repeatable units of work. In a world of continuous deployment, developers can't afford not to build in great DevOps tools as well.

          <p>
            Confidentiality, integrity and availability aren't just information security key words, they should be fundamentals of applications. Security shouldn't be an afterthought of software development, but a baked-in feature from the beginning. Following good, risk-based security practices ensures the application are built to survive in the modern web ecosystem.
